# The Testament of an Unknown Disc Golfer

> Fellow disc golfers, I believe I have found a way to throw backhand efficiently.

## Preface

When teaching a sport the teacher, or the coach, is often expected to show merit in that sport. Although I will argue a coach is not required to be competitive in the sport they are teaching, it will be prudent to state that I'm not a disc golf champion at any level.

I have invested time and effort over the last five years to understand and learn the disc golf backhand throw. My sources and methods have been the usual: fellow players and YouTube videos, practice, experimentation and contemplating. Now, I want to pass what I have learned to you.

I'm aware that this kind of content is expected to be in video format nowadays. I don't have the means or the skills to create such videos. Instead, I'll resort to the age-old method of writing words (with maybe a couple of pictures or links to videos to clear things up). I will apply a decidedly provocative style to keep the message clear, and I'll drop names with reckless abandon. I don't mean to attack or discredit anyone.

In this piece, I'll first explain what I'm trying to achieve, then we'll look into the compound movement of the backhand throw as a whole, and go deeper from there. Along the way I'll add personal opinions and anecdotes to aid in understanding the presented ideas.

## The Goal

When learning a skill with a high degree of automaticity, especially without a coach, it is crucial to have a simple mental model that will guide you to the right direction as you progress. This mental model consists of an idea, an ideal and a set of cues that will help you approach that ideal. In the best case scenario the model can remain unchanged while you get better with practice.

My goal is to convey this mental model I have created for myself, and which I believe to be a good one, to you.

## The Backhand

> Disc golf backhand throw is a difficult movement. If that's not the case for you, you got lucky.

The first thing to realize is that the backhand throw is, or should be treated as an automatic skill. As archery coach Alistair Whittingham put it (https://performance-archery.com/automatic-skill/), you practice an automatic skill and prepare for the execution of an automatic skill cognitively ("with thought"), but you execute it non-cognitively ("without thought").

You should consider the difference between practicing (a part of) the throw and executing a throw. Executing a throw non-cognitively is a requirement to make the movement smooth and relaxed.

The next thing to realize is that the flight of the disc is not part of your throw; it is the result of your throw, the disc characteristics and the environment. You can influence the initial direction (vertical and horizontal), the hyzer/anhyzer angle, the nose angle and the velocity of the disc. That's it. No, you don't control the spin either.

This is why I would recommend practicing the throw on a net or at least without paying much or any attention on where the disc lands; practicing the discs and the shot shapes is a separate part of the game.

Now that we have gone through what happens inside your head when throwing, we can move on to what happens with your body.

YouTube has many videos breaking down the backhand throw. Depending on the video the movement might have one or a dozen stages or parts in it. This model has three.

> The components of a backhand throw, in chronological order:
>1. Steps (building forward momentum)
>2. Brace and turn (converting forward momentum into rotation)
>3. Hit (timing the release of the disc)

## The Hit

When talking about cues, the selection of words is important. For example, I choose to say "steps" instead of "run-up", since you don't have to run. It is also important to make clear if and how cues depend on each other and whether they are actions or consequences.

Let's take "snap" as an example. Numerous videos talk about snap in a disc golf throw. The problem with word "snap" is that it is ambiguous. Some consider snap as the sound the release of the disc may or may not make. Others understand snap as the movement being "snappy". Neither of these interpretations are very helpful as they don't guide you to do the right thing.

In this mental model the final part of the throw is called "hit". As "snap" told us next to nothing, "hit" is instructive. "Hit" is what we do, and "snap" is what happens.

Hit is an act of extending your elbow from a 90 degree angle to straight. Hit is the culmination and the channeling of the energy gathered in your shoulder rotation. Hit is timing the release of the disc.

> Ezra Aderhold explains this crucial movement very well here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQIzQcY05nE.

So, for a backhand throw, imagine a target, like a sheet of paper, floating in the air at an arm's length in front of you, at a height matching your intended hyzer/anhyzer angle, and somewhere above your front foot. Rotate your shoulders and hit through the paper with the back of your hand. Rotate fast and there's your drive. Rotate slower (and shorter), and there's your approach.

**The hit is the throw**. Everything we do before it just serves to make the hit harder (=faster) and more efficient (=smoother/easier). We let the follow-through happen on its own and observe casually as the disc completes its flight... or hits the first available.

## How to spend years without progress

For most of us the backhand throw is a new movement. You are given a disc and some friendly advice and you throw. Then you are given some more friendly advice and you throw again. Cool, it's fun, and you are getting better at it quickly. You might even have some talent. At the same time you have developed a random throwing technique for yourself.

Next, you'll check out some YouTube videos. The friendly person in the video tells you that to get the distance you need to pull on the disc hard, like starting a lawnmower. Next one tells you the secret to unlocking power is in the reachback. OK, so you reach back and start a lawnmower. You feel like you gained some power and consistency, but the distance maxes out at under 100 meters. What's next?

Aha, this video says that the throw is like a whip, that the movement starts from the base and moves up the body and out to the disc. Makes sense. Well, I continued starting the lawnmower with a whip and it didn't work out. Lawnmower encourages early acceleration and the whip late acceleration, and between them lies a desert of deceleration.

The trap where I and, I daresay, most players have fallen into, is the idea of pulling - that the energy of the throw is generated with the leading edge of your body. Well, it is not, we need to turn that around.

Another trap is to rely on power in general. As unintuitive as it may sound, the perceived effort does not correlate well with the disc velocity. In my case it took a sports radar to make me believe that.

> So, whatever you do, don't try to fix your throw by throwing harder. That effort will be wasted.

## The Brace

The brace is another term mentioned in multiple videos. It sounds important, and it is, but what does it do, and how do you actually brace?

For the longest time I thought bracing serves to just stop your forward momentum, giving your body support to accelerate the disc. In reality, you often end up _absorbing_ the forward momentum and _trying_ to accelerate the disc after that.

> The key is _not_ to absord the momentum, but to convert it into rotation.

Converting forward momentum into rotation is all about geometry and levers. Instead of stacking your weight directly behind the leading foot and leg (which leaves us with no rotational forces), we must pivot around the leading hip joint. Now, let's connect some dots.

You have seen and heard the advice to bend your knees and stay _athletic_ during a throw? Well, obviously it's not a good idea to stay stiff while performing a dynamic movement, but there's even more to that.

Bending your knees and taking an athletic stance puts your hip joints into flexion. And applying force on one leg while your hip joints are bent creates a rotational force at your hips. Instead of resisting and absorbing this force, you should allow it to turn your hips. In fact, you should assist it with your back leg. **This is what initiates your rotation.**

When the bracing starts your body should be at full wind-up: the hips are slightly turned away from the target and the shoulders are rotated further, up to 180 degrees from the target. See Overthrow Disc Golf (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4LCYbEROzep8Cw0lZWAJ4A) for the fax [sic].

## The Turn

Your brace hits the ground and starts to turn your hips. The knee of the back leg turns forward and pushes the hips further. At the same time, the front leg stiffens and adds to the turn. **This is the bottom layer of rotation.**

The shoulders are left behind and start to catch up as you rotate the rear shoulder forward. Non-throwing arm is actively assisting the movement. **This is the top layer of rotation.**

Attached to the top layer is your throwing arm. The arm does no active movement before the hit; it merely keeps up with the shoulders to avoid collapsing into your body. **This is the outer layer of rotation.**

The phase difference, or the lag, between the layers creates the spring effect and the disc lag (another great Overthrow Disc Golf concept) we are looking for.

## The Practice

All of the above is just a theory and an idea. It's something you can reference when you are looking for the next thing to work on. It is a bad idea, and impossible, to think about all this while you are throwing. Instead, let's get there with a set of drills.

The first thing you should practice is the hit. You have to learn how a well-timed hit feels, and how the arm does nothing but extends in front of your body.

### Getting the Hit

You can practice the hit by standing still in a staggered stance, holding your throwing arm in the power box or power pocket position, rotating your shoulders back and forth slightly and performing the hit repeatedly. Keep the arm and the hand relaxed and tighten your grip at the moment of the hit.

At first the hips don't move much, and the free arm is passive. Once you get into the groove, you can gradually increase the range of the rotation at both the shoulders and the hips, and the free arm becomes more active.

The mass of the disc can affect the timing and the feel of the hit. You should practice with a disc or another object of similar weight as well, to see if it makes a difference for you.

### Getting the Rotation

You can practice your rotation, your timing and your power by delivering a low heavy cross with your back hand (at about 45 degrees off from your throwing direction).

A heavy cross punch requires a solid push with the back leg, rotation of the hips, and it encourages a slight lag between the hips and shoulders. All of these happen to be exactly what we are looking for in a backhand throw to generate power, to emphasize the role of the trailing part of your body, and to de-emphasize the front side of the same.

Once you get a feel of the timing, you can move on from punching with your fist to punching with your trailing shoulder. Punching with the shoulder intuitively makes use of the free arm and helps develop your ability to rotate your shoulders (very) fast.

## The Steps

Taking steps allows us to build momentum for the brace. How you take your steps and how many they are, doesn't matter too much. Feel free to experiment.

Things to consider when experimenting with steps:
1. It would be nice to fit all the steps on a decently sized teepad
2. You should be able to scale the steps down as needed, all the way to a standstill
3. The steps should feel smooth and not waste momentum, i.e. don't force anything, let it roll

My recommendation is a staggered four-step sequence as taught by Jalle Stoor. This is how you do it:
1. Imagine a line on the ground towards your throwing direction
2. Stand off the line on your throwing hand's side. Face the line diagonally
3. Step forward onto the line with the foot on the side of your free hand (starting off)
4. Next step should land on the far side of the line with your foot at 90 degrees with the line (aligning with the throwing direction)
5. Step behind the other foot landing on the near side of the line (X-step)
6. Plant the last step on the far side of the line (brace)

> Tomas Ekström demonstrates these steps perfectly in the beginning of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppnmwkr2jO0.

## The Rest

1. For a cleaner release and "a louder slap", concentrate the pressure in your grip on the fingers farthest away from your body. This will make your arm effectively longer.
2. For a more efficient hit and better angle consistency, move your arm in a flat plane, i.e. imagine sweeping towards the hit with your leading elbow.
3. Remember that your putt still has the biggest impact on your score.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope it was helpful.
